# Index Page - User Authentication:
The initiation of this interactive Dash application commences with the Index Page, which serves as a secure gateway for users. Within this interface, users are prompted to input their credentials for authentication purposes. This essential step guarantees access to authorized individuals.

# Application Page - Insights and Exploration:
Upon successful authentication, users are welcomed into the heart of the application - the Application Page. This page boasts a user-friendly interface designed for optimal exploration and analysis of sentiment-based insights. Divided into four distinct tabs - Initial Insights, Employee, User Stories, and Teams.

# Initial Insights Tab:
In the Initial Insights tab of the dashboard, users are presented with a comprehensive snapshot of key metrics. This includes the total number of Employees in a project, the number of teams in a project, and the number of Open and Closed User Stories, providing a holistic view of the dataset's scope.

# Employee Tab:
In this tab, users encounter two dropdowns: dropdown1, which presents the list of team names, and dropdown2, offering the list of employee names. By selecting a particular employee within a specific team, users gain access to the performance score of that employee on a monthly basis throughout the year.

# User Stories Tab:
Within this tab, users once again encounter two dropdowns: dropdown1, populated with the list of team names, and dropdown2, containing the list of employee names. Upon selecting a particular employee within a specific team, users are presented with the total number of User Stories assigned to that employee, as well as the total number opened and closed by that individual for every month.

# Teams Tab:
In this tab, users are presented with a dropdown to select the team name. Upon selection, the tab displays the average number of open and closed User Stories, as well as the performance score of that particular team for every month. This feature facilitates a comprehensive understanding of team performance over time.

By encapsulating these features and functionalities, the Dash application offers users a powerful platform for insightful exploration and analysis of project data.
